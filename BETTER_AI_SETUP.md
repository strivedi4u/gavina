## Why Current Responses Are Basic

The "Enhanced Local Analysis" is just smart text matching. It's good for finding facts but can't generate human-like responses. With Groq or Ollama, you'll get:

- âœ… Complete, coherent answers
- âœ… Proper explanations
- âœ… Context understanding
- âœ… Natural language responses

## Quick Test

After setting up either option, ask the same question and see the difference:

**Before**: "Based on the provided information: The scary truth about AI..."
**After**: "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence..."

Choose one option above and your RAG app will become much smarter! ðŸ§ âœ¨
